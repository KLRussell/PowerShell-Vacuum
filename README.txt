- DO NOT MOVE OR DELETE THE LOG FOLDERS WITHIN "01_Updates"!

- This "01_Updates" folder is a repository for update + error logs generated by the CNR/Dispute 
automation system. 

- Each teammate has both an CNR Audit workbook and a Dispute log workbook to submit disputes and other
updates on Zero Revenue lines + additional items of cost such as end-dated, unmapped, timing, etc...
that they may be auditing.

- When an update is submitted or saved through the Auditors CNR workbook, a log file is then generated 
by the CNR_Audit_Workbook.xlsm's built in VBS macro scripts (Dispute Logs will later be built on a
similiar structure).
	
	- The log files are generated as text/.csv files and is temporary pushed to a subfolder
	within this "01_Updates" folder.

	- The placement of the logs within the subfolders is determined by the action submitted from
	the CNR Workbook according to the different cost sources they emanate from.

		- The CNR Audit Workbooks will be push items to the "01_BMI"/"02_PCI" directories,
		which is shown below. Depending on the auditor's submitted intended action, 
		the logs will append to one of the six sub-folders below between BMI and PCI. Please
		note that the 03_Prov & 04_LV folders are not yet utilized and will be utilized in a
		later version of powershell/workbook.

			- 01_BMI
				- 01_Map
				- 02_Dispute
				- 03_Prov (Not Used Yet)
				- 04_LV (Not Used Yet)
				- 05_Other
				- 06_Errors
			- 02_PCI
				- 01_Map
				- 02_Dispute
				- 03_Prov (Not Used Yet)
				- 04_LV (Not Used Yet)
				- 05_Other
				- 06_Errors

		- Dispute Logs, in the future, will eventually append txt/csv files to these
		sub-directories below under 01_Updates. Items entered through the Dispute Log Workbooks
		will be pushed to either "03_Seeds" or "O4_Non-Seeds" directory.

			- 03_Seeds (Not Used Yet)
				- 01_To_Be_Processed
				- 02_Errors
			- 04_Non-Seeds (Not Used Yet)
				- 01_To_Be_Processed
				- 02_Errors
				
- After the txt/csv is generated by the workbook and is pushed to the correct sub-directory, the update
automation system dubbed... "THE VACUUM" takes over and processes the various txt/csv files. "THE VACUUM"
system is a series of PowerShell scripts written in A_Vacuum_Automation.ps1 and B_Vacuum_Module.psm1 files.
A menu PowerShell script named CAT_Menu.ps1 is a menu list that launches "THE VACUUM" and other CAT operations.

	- As for "THE VACUUM", it sucks up the txt/csv files, uses logic to interpret the contents of the
	txt/csv files, passes updates/new disputes through the below tables, and deletes the
	txt/csv files from the directory. 

			# Table name (Read & Write) [These Global Variables are found in the B_Vacuum_Module.psm1 file]

				- $Global:t_BMM="";
				- $Global:t_BMB="";
				- $Global:t_Unmapped="";
				- $Global:t_ZeroRevenue="";
				- $Global:t_DisputeStaging="";
				- $Global:t_EmailExtract="";
				- $Global:t_PCI="";
				- $Global:t_PCI_BMB="";
				- $Global:t_PCI_Unmapped="";
				- $Global:t_PCI_ZeroRevenue="";


	- This process happens very quickly. You will be unlikely to see the txt/csv file land in one of 
	the update subfolders.

	- In order to ensure that the files are being logged; picked up; and processed
	by the vacuum properly, we have created the "02_Event_Log" folder in the main source directory.
	
	- if you would really like to verify "THE VACUUM" process, please have CDA switch the Vacuum off while a
	skilled person in VBA & PowerShell isolate a copy of the environment in a test environment; writing to
	different (Read & Write) tables that are described above. Essentially, PowerShell v5.1 or higher and
	Local Computer Admin will be needed to run the Vacuum. A replicated CNR workbook will need to be made
	to write into the pathways of the test environment. I have adjusted singular pathing variables in the
	CAT_Menu.ps1, A_Vacuum_Automation.ps1, and CNR Workbook; Global Variable within CNR Workbook can be
	found under the CNR_Functions module, and within the assign_global_variables() subroutine under variables
	"filepath" and "sql_filepath".

- AGAIN, DO NOT MOVE, DELETE, OR RENAME ANY FOLDER/SUB-FOLDERS WITHIN "CAT_Operations"!
	- If you must make any changes to the directory or the files within...

		- ASK CDA FIRST!

		- KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING! IF CDA IS UNABLE TO MAKE THE CHANGES AND HAS AUTHORIZED YOU TO MAKE CHANGES,
		BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE CHANGING OR UPDATING. IT IS VERY EASY TO MESS UP DATA INTEGRITY OR
		A WORKING SYSTEM!

		- ADDITIONALLY, PLZ NOTATE ANY CHANGES WITHIN POWERSHELL OR VBA SCRIPTS!
		
		- NOTE: ANY CHANGES MADE HERE WILL HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE VBA + POWERSHELL CODE 
		THAT POINTS TO OR REFERENCES THESE LOG FILES!
